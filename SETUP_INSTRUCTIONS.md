# üöÄ Dragon Bundle - Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed:
‚úÖ **Created `.env` file** with required Shopify credentials  
‚úÖ **Improved error handling** to prevent UI crashes  
‚úÖ **Added helpful error messages** for connection issues  

---

## üîß Quick Fix Steps:

### 1. **Get Your Shopify API Secret**

The app is currently configured with the API Key, but **you need to add your API Secret**.

1. Go to [Shopify Partner Dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com)
2. Navigate to **Apps** ‚Üí Find your **Dragon Bundle** app
3. Click on the app to open its settings
4. Copy the **API Secret Key** (also called Client Secret)

### 2. **Update the `.env` File**

Open the file: `dragon-bundle-2-0/.env`

Find this line:
```env
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

Replace `your_api_secret_here` with your **actual API Secret** from Step 1.

Example:
```env
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=shpss_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies (if not already done)**

```powershell
cd dragon-bundle-2-0
npm install
```

### 4. **Set Up the Database**

```powershell
cd dragon-bundle-2-0
npm run setup
```

This will:
- Generate Prisma client
- Create the database schema
- Apply migrations

### 5. **Start the Development Server**

```powershell
cd dragon-bundle-2-0
npm run dev
```

This will start the Shopify CLI development server with ngrok tunneling.

## üéØ What Was Fixed:

### Problem 1: UI Crashing
**Before:** App would crash with no error message when Shopify credentials were missing.  
**After:** App now shows a beautiful error page with clear instructions on how to fix the issue.

### Problem 2: Unable to Connect to admin.shopify.com
**Before:** Generic error with no guidance.  
**After:** The app checks for missing credentials and provides:
- Clear error message
- Step-by-step fix instructions
- Links to relevant documentation

### Problem 3: Missing Environment Variables
**Before:** No `.env` file, causing immediate crashes.  
**After:** Created `.env` file with all required variables (just need to add API Secret).

## üîç Troubleshooting:

### Still seeing "Unable to Connect to Shopify"?

1. **Check your API Secret:**
   ```powershell
   Get-Content dragon-bundle-2-0\.env | Select-String "SHOPIFY_API_SECRET"
   ```
   Make sure it's not `your_api_secret_here`.

2. **Verify your app URL:**
   - When running `npm run dev`, Shopify CLI will give you a preview URL
   - Make sure this URL matches what's in your Partner Dashboard

3. **Check app scopes:**
   - Go to Partner Dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Configuration
   - Ensure the scopes match what's in `.env` and `shopify.app.toml`

### Database Issues?

If you see Prisma errors:
```powershell
cd dragon-bundle-2-0
rm dev.sqlite
npm run setup
```

### Port Already in Use?

Kill the process on port 3000:
```powershell
Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
```
